👉 NextJS vs ReactJS: Features
When comparing NextJS and React, the first thing to look at is their features. Both frameworks have a lot to offer, but there are some key differences between them.
It's important to note them NextJS is based on React and is meant to amplity it's capabilities and provide tools to make the most out of react.

👉 ReactJS:
💚 Ease of use: React is easy to learn and use, making it a good choice for developers who are new to JavaScript frameworks.
Component based: React allows you to create reusable components, which can be used to build complex user interfaces and applications.
💚 Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual DOM, which makes it fast and efficient when rendering large lists of data or complex user interfaces.
💚 JSX: JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTMLlike code inside JavaScript files. Data binding: React uses oneway data binding, which means that data flows in one direction from the parent component to the child component.
💚 Extensibility: React can be extended with thirdparty libraries and plugins to add additional functionality if needed.


👉 Next.js:
🟠 Serverside rendering: Next.js comes with builtin support for serverside rendering, which can improve the performance of your application. Static site generation: With Next.js, you can generate static versions of your pages, which can be deployed without a server.
🟠 Routing: Next.js has builtin routing capabilities, making it easy to create singlepage applications (SPAs).
🟠 TypeScript support: TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that enables type checking and other advanced features. Next.js comes with builtin support for TypeScript out of the box.
